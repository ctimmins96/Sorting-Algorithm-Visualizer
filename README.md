# Sorting Algorithm Visualizer

## Purpose

This has been a fun project of mine to help visualize the inner workings of sorting algorithms. It is a fun mental exercise to write these algorithms in an iterable fashion version a 'method' implementation.

## Description



The BubbleSort, HeapSort, and QuickSort have been added to show the number of compare operations as well as time-to-completion relative to each algorithm.
